#### Thurs 5 Nov 2020 update: I uploaded this repository in a rush and didn't realize I hadn't finished consolodating relevent projects. I have added my game SpaceShooter, which was written in C++ with SFML. I am away from my office until tomorrow and do not have a C++ compiler on my laptop, but I've pulled a copy from my Dropbox, but I am unsure of whether or not it will compile and run. I will test, update, add more projects, and revise README to more accurately explain projects by COB Fri 6 Nov.
